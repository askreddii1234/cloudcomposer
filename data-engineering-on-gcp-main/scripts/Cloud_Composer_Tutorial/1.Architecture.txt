Google Cloud Composer Architecture

Overview
Google Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service built on Apache Airflow. It simplifies the process of managing, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Here's a detailed look at the architecture of Google Cloud Composer:

Core Components
Google Cloud Composer Environment:

This is the primary resource that users interact with. It consists of several managed components that together provide a fully functional Airflow setup.
Airflow Scheduler:

The scheduler is responsible for scheduling jobs. It parses the DAGs, determines their dependencies, and schedules tasks for execution.
Airflow Web Server:

The web server provides the user interface for Airflow. Users can access this UI to manage and monitor their workflows, view logs, and see task statuses.
Airflow Workers:

Workers are responsible for executing the tasks defined in the DAGs. They pick up tasks from the queue and run them.
Airflow Metadata Database:

This is a PostgreSQL database managed by Cloud Composer. It stores the state of the DAGs, task instances, and other metadata required by Airflow.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

Cloud Composer uses GKE to run the Airflow components. Each environment is essentially a Kubernetes cluster that hosts the Airflow web server, scheduler, and workers.
Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

GCS is used to store DAG files, logs, and other artifacts. Each Composer environment has a dedicated bucket where users can upload their DAG files.
Google Cloud SQL:

This service provides the managed PostgreSQL database for the Airflow metadata.
Google Cloud Pub/Sub:

Used for communication between different components, especially for task distribution and inter-component messaging.
Identity and Access Management (IAM):

IAM controls access to Composer environments and their components. It ensures that only authorized users and services can interact with the Composer resources.
Data Flow
User Interaction:

Users define their workflows by writing DAGs in Python and upload these DAGs to the GCS bucket associated with their Composer environment.
DAG Parsing:

The Airflow scheduler continuously monitors the DAG folder in GCS. When a new DAG is detected, the scheduler parses it and schedules the tasks based on the defined schedule.
Task Execution:

The scheduler places the tasks in a queue. Airflow workers pick up tasks from this queue and execute them. The workers run in the GKE cluster managed by Composer.
Logging and Monitoring:

During execution, task logs are written to the GCS bucket. Users can view these logs through the Airflow UI.
The status and metadata of each task execution are stored in the Cloud SQL database.
Error Handling and Retries:

If a task fails, Airflowâ€™s built-in retry mechanism can reattempt the task based on the retry policy defined in the DAG. All retry attempts and errors are logged and can be monitored through the UI.
High Availability and Scalability
High Availability:

Cloud Composer environments are designed for high availability. Components like the Airflow scheduler and workers run in multiple replicas within the GKE cluster to ensure redundancy.
Scalability:

Composer can scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes to the GKE cluster as the workload increases. This scaling can be manual or automatic, depending on the configuration.
